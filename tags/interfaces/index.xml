I&amp;rsquo;ve started a new job @ CloudCover and have also started contributing to golang projects!
The inspiration for this post comes from a (slightly) confusing topic in golang which I initially struggled to understand, and that&amp;rsquo;s interfaces!
This post doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover what interfaces are! There are lots of really good articles on the internet for that.
What I really want to focus on is &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo; you can use them and what common pitfalls to avoid (especially if you come from Java / C#)</description></item></channel></rss>
