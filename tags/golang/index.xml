I wanted to implement something like UDP Hole Punching and came across this mailing list message from 2016 which linked to the contrib/nat-hole-punching source in Wireguard.
I&amp;rsquo;ll cover the whole hole punching mechanism, perhaps, in a different article. But for context, the mentioned source used raw linux sockets and classic Berkeley Packet Filter to inject custom packets and do hole punching.</description></item><item><title>Using interfaces in Go</title><link>https://riyazali.net/posts/using-interfaces-in-go/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://riyazali.net/posts/using-interfaces-in-go/</guid><description>A lot have changed in the past few months!
I&amp;rsquo;ve started a new job @ CloudCover and have also started contributing to golang projects!
The inspiration for this post comes from a (slightly) confusing topic in golang which I initially struggled to understand, and that&amp;rsquo;s interfaces!
This post doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover what interfaces are! There are lots of really good articles on the internet for that.
What I really want to focus on is &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo; you can use them and what common pitfalls to avoid (especially if you come from Java / C#)</description></item></channel></rss>
