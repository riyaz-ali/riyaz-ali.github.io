The challenge was to load poster images from TMDb Image server inside my app!
Is it even a challenge? One could say that I could&amp;rsquo;ve simply used a library like Picasso or Glide to offload image loading to the tried and trusted tools. But my main challenge was not just to load the image but to load the perfect image.</description></item><item><title>Android Support Paging Library</title><link>https://riyazali.net/posts/android-support-paging-library/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://riyazali.net/posts/android-support-paging-library/</guid><description>Recently, I was working on a project for the Udacity Android Nanodegree program to develop an Android application for TMDb to list movies using the TMDb API.

I wanted to develop an Android application (open source) and to collaborate with my peers on Google Udacity Android scholarship program. On the Udacity discussion forum, there were many threads filled with exciting ideas but they all were either too ambitious or required quite a bit of time.
Then, one day while checking into the forum an idea struck me!</description></item></channel></rss>
